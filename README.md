Loading user-saved images on app startup.

3. photo_view

PhotoView(
  imageProvider: FileImage(File(imagePath)),
);

## Use Case


 The image displays a use case diagram illustrating the user 
journey for selecting an image from a mobile device's gallery. It begins with a client 
device (Android or iPhone) initiating the "Open Image Gallery App" action. This leads to 
the display of various folders (e.g., Camera, Downloads, Screenshots). The user then 
selects a folder, after which the images within that chosen folder are displayed, allowing 
the user to pick a specific image before the process concludes.

## Sequence Diagram

This image depicts a flowchart of an image gallery application's 
user flow. It illustrates how a user can browse image folders, then view individual 
images, and enter a fullscreen mode. From fullscreen, options for sharing, editing (like 
cropping or enhancing), and setting the image as wallpaper are presented.

## Output


üñºÔ∏è **Main Gallery Screen (`home_screen.dart`)**

* Shows a **grid of images** from the `assets/image/` or `assets/camera/` folder.
* Simple, clean UI using `GridView`.
* Tapping an image can optionally open it in fullscreen (not included since `full_image_screen.dart` was removed).

### üìå App Layout:

```
+------------------------------------+
|           Image Gallery App        |
+------------------------------------+
| [Image 1]  [Image 2]  [Image 3]    |
| [Image 4]  [Image 5]  [Image 6]    |
|  ... Loaded from assets/...        |
+------------------------------------+
```

* Each image tile is square and scrollable.
* No zoom/fullscreen support (since you removed `full_image_screen.dart`).
* No file services or data models (clean structure).

## Conclusion


### ‚úÖ **Conclusion: Simplified Flutter Image Gallery App**

You‚Äôve successfully designed a **minimal Flutter Image Gallery App** structure with only essential components. Here's what this final version includes:

---

üìÇ **Project Summary**

* **No Firebase** ‚Äî Local-only image gallery
* **No extra complexity** ‚Äî Removed full-screen viewer, services, models, and utility files
* **Flat structure** ‚Äî Only `main.dart` and `home_screen.dart` handle the UI logic
* **Assets-based loading** ‚Äî Displays images from `assets/image/` and `assets/camera/`

---

üöÄ **What Works**

* Clean, basic grid of images using `GridView`
* Easy to extend later (picker, fullscreen view, sharing, etc.)
* Lightweight and suitable for beginners

---

üß± **Next Steps (Optional Enhancements)**

If you want to build on this base:

* Add **image\_picker** to allow importing new images
* Add **fullscreen view** using `photo_view`
* Use **share\_plus** to share images
* Integrate **permission\_handler** for camera/gallery access
